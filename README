Buildhistory warnings web interface
===================================

This is a small Django-based web application that allows you to process
the repository generated by the buildhistory feature in OpenEmbedded
(OE-Core) and review any generated warnings about potential issues.

For more information on buildhistory, see the following page:

  https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Buildhistory


Setup
-----

In order to make use of this application you will need:

* A web server set up to host Django applications
* A database supported by Django (SQLite, MySQL, etc.)
* On the machine that will run the import script (which does not have to
  be the same machine as the web server - could be the build machine;
  however it does still have to have Django installed and have access
  to the database used by the web application):
  * Access to (a clone of) the buildhistory git repository produced by
    the build system
  * Python 2.6 or Python 2.7
  * A copy of BitBake and OE-Core (or Poky, which includes both) -
    the "danny" release or newer is required.
  * GitPython (python-git) version 0.3.1 or later
* django-registration

You'll need to edit settings.py to specify a database, EMAIL_HOST and
other settings specific to your installation.


Usage
-----

On a regular basis (either scheduled, or after each build) you need to
run warningmgr/import.py, specifying the git sha1 hash from the
buildhistory repository the last time the script was run (since the
script will analyse commits after that one), then record the latest
hash ready for the next time.

You can then review any warnings generated by accessing the web
application.
